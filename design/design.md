# introduction
this is a document that describes all my thoughts/ideas, design and features to build this library.

# goal
the main goal of this utility is to handle strings with less effort. things like creating a new string, manipulating strings, copying strings and much more should be accessible via a single function call.

moreover, these functions which operate on the strings must be efficient. 


# fixed size strings
to get things started, working on fixed size strings seems the most logical choice. we can expand on dynamic length strings later.
